# Hi, I'm Prashaman Pokharel 👋

I’m an engineer working at the intersection of AI, data, and backend systems. I build production-grade AI systems and data platforms, from real-time ingestion and analytics to model training, deployment, and monitoring.


I’m actively seeking full-time opportunities (or to join an early-stage startup) starting Feb 2026. I completed my MISM (BI & Data Analytics) at Carnegie Mellon University in Dec 2025.
